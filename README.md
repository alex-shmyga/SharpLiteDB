# SharpLiteDB

A fun and educational project to build a simple SQL database engine in C#, inspired by SQLite! This project is a step-by-step exploration of database fundamentals, created to learn and understand how a database engine operates behind the scenes.


#### Why This Project?
This project is purely for fun and learning! It’s a great way to understand database engines without the complexity of production-level software. By building this, you'll get a closer look at:
- How data is stored in tables and rows.
- How a database engine parses SQL commands.
- Concepts like indexing, transactions, and page-based storage.


#### Setup and Usage
To get started, clone the repository and open it in your C# development environment.

#### Prerequisites
.NET SDK (version 8 or higher)


#### Example of supported commands

> CREATE TABLE users

> INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice')

> SELECT * FROM users
Current Limitations

note: This project is a simplified learning tool, so it doesn’t support:
- Complex SQL syntax or advanced queries.
- Persistent storage (yet!).
- Optimization for large data sets.


Stay tuned for additional features as the project evolves!
